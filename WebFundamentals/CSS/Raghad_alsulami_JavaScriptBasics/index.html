                <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>

                <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. 
                    It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility 
                    for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
                    JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
                    it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                    programmatic control over them. </p>

                
                <ul> 
                    <li> <span class="title"> Variable Declaration </span> JavaScript variables are containers for
                        storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, 
                        the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All 
                        JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. 
                        These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="highlight">var x;</span> </li>

                    <li> <span class="title"> Variable Assignment </span> Assignment operators assign values to 
                        JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                        giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator
                        assigns a value to a variable. <span class="highlight">var x= 10;</span> </li>

                    <li> <span class="title"> Data Types </span> Data types are an important concept; 
                        to be able to operate on variables you need to know the 
                        data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: 
                        Boolean, - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - <span class="highlight">42</span> 
                        or <span class="highlight">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="highlight">"Coding Dojo Rocks!;"
                        </span> Array - <span class="highlight"> [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - 
                        <span class="highlight"> {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'} </span> </li>

                    <li> <span class="title"> Conditionals </span> When you write code, you want to perform 
                        different actions for different decisions - hitting different code 
                        blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. 
                        You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. 
                        There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition 
                        is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="highlight">else if</span> to 
                        specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                        <span class="highlight">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                            
                    <li> <span class="title"> Loops </span> There are many different kinds of loops in every
                        programming language, but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                        an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you 
                        run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! </li>

                    <li> <span class="title"> Functions </span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. 
                        When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a 
                        list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk 
                        from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw 
                        the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! 
                        We finished out instructions. Sadly there a a ton more table to do so 
                        lets call our function over and over again. </li>
                </ul>
